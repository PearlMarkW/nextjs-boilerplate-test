                    <p class="mt-6 text-xl">Experience supporting and directly working in private equity has contributed to our team’s conviction that the industry, and more specifically funds, need to evolve.</p>
                    <p class="mt-1 text-xl">The environment has shifted dramatically away from the industry’s founding where financial leverage and multiple accretion were enough to be successful. Other scaling factors have also been diluted to where a new approach is needed to maintain returns at an appreciable level.</p>
                    <p class="mt-1 text-xl">Advances in technology, and practical application of their capabilities to the “right” opportunities, can create leverage for teams willing to evolve and take a new approach to deal making.</p>
                    <p class="mt-1 text-xl">Our partners are informed throughout the entire deal lifecycle. From sourcing new opportunities, diligence, and throughout the hold period, we provide visibility and insight so there aren’t any avoidable surprises.</p>\
                    <p class="mt-1 text-xl">We confidently tackle the challenge today’s markets present.</p>
